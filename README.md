**Recursive Transformations for Lydio Nodes**

Lydio Bubbles provide a powerful mechanism for **automated transformations** across an entire hierarchy of Lydio nodes. This package includes the **most commonly used bubbles**, with more being added as foundationally useful patterns emerge.

## Installation

```js
npm install lydio
npm install @lydio/bubbles
```

**Note** lydio is required but not listed as a dependency to simplify installation on private package managers. Please ensure both are installed!

## What is a Lydio Bubble?

A **Bubble** is a core Lydio feature that **recursively applies transformations** across a hierarchy of Lydio nodes. Bubbles allow you to **modify, classify, or audit** elements in a structured way without manually iterating through them.

This package provides a collection of the most useful bubbles, including:  
âœ… **BEM Bubble** â€“ Applies Block-Element-Modifier naming conventions.  
âœ… **Namespace Bubble** â€“ Adds a prefix to all class names in a hierarchy.  
âœ… **Semantic Class Bubble** â€“ Assigns a class based on the elementâ€™s semantic tag.

## BEM Bubble

Applies **Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) naming conventions** to all elements in a hierarchy.

```js
import bubbles from '@lydio/bubbles';
lydioNode.bubble(bubbles.bemBubble('my-cmp'));
```

**example output:**

```html
<div class="component my-cmp__component">
    <p class="fancy-text my-cmp__fancy-text"></p>
</div>
```

## Namespace Bubble

Prefixes all class names in a hierarchy with a **namespace identifier**.

```js
import bubbles from '@lydio/bubbles';
lydioNode.bubble(bubbles.namespaceBubble('ä¸»'));
```

**example output:**

```html
<div class="component ä¸»component">
    <p class="fancy-text ä¸»fancy-text"></p>
</div>
```

## Semantic Class Bubble

```js
import bubbles from '@lydio/bubbles';
lydioNode.bubble(bubbles.semanticClassBubble());
```

**example output:**

```html
<div class="component">
    <p class="fancy-class p"></p>
</div>
```
